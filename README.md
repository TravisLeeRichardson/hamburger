# hamburger


This code calls out to an API via "GET" and then returns a random _hamburger_ from the result.<br>
PUT, DELETE and POST are also provided, but just hard-coded for now. This is just sandbox code.<br>

I used HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>

*Step 1* Download the files to your computer.<br>
*Step 2* Open up index.html.<br>
*Step 3* Click on the "Click Me" Button.<br>
